Description: Ribostan is a simple package which contains functionality related
  to ribosomal footprint data and quantitative analysis thereof. It includes
  functions to align A/P sites by maximizing including in the CDS, to produce
  plots of KL divergence in 'metacodon' plots, and to estimate Ribosomal Footprint
  densities in an isoform aware manner.
