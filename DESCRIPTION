Description: Ribostan is a simple package which contains functionality related
  to ribosomal footprint data and quantitative analysis thereof. It includes
  functions to align A/P sites by maximizing including in the CDS, to produce
  plots of KL divergence in 'metacodon' plots, and to estimate Ribosomal Footprint
  densities in an isoform aware manner. It also provides functions for quantifying
  periodicity of open reading frames, and identifying translated uORFs.
